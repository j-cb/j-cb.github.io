My [mathematics bachelor thesis](/docs/Synthetic_Geometry.pdf): The construction of two topoi that have a number line with nilsquare infinitesimals.

My [physics bachelor thesis](/docs/Path_Integration_via_Infinitesimal_Complex_Time_Phases.pdf): A justification of rotating from real to imaginary time, a well known trick for calculating Feynman path integrals.

A generalization of the [Tannaka Duality](/docs/TannakaDuality.pdf) for finite groups with arbitrary fields. (Seminar exposé)

A seminar exposé together with Viet-Anh Nguyen on integrable models in statistical mechanics, the Young-Baxter equation and [quantum groups (french)](/docs/GroupesQuantiques.pdf ).

A 2D representation of some [italian artworks](/misc/2018-07-12_14h30_3176Friuli-last01.html).
